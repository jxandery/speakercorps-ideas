### Writing a Proposal

Here's my outline for a good proposal:

* Opening that explains the problem
* Concrete outline that demonstrates you actually have something to say
* Conclusion with what the attendees will take away from the session

As an example, here's a proposal I submitted to RubyConf 2013: https://github.com/speakercorps/proposals/blob/master/individual_work/casimir_jeff/computing_from_first_principles.markdown

A few other things you should keep in mind:

### Keep It Short

Many conferences are going to review over a hundred submissions, and some as many as five hundred. The organizers are already stressed trying to nail down the venue, sell tickets, all while trying to do their jobs and live their lives. 

You're not doing yourself any favors by writing a dissertation. Your proposal should be readable in under a minute.

### Be Humble, But Not Too Humble

I described an author once by saying "if he had three hands, they'd *all* be patting himself on the back." The voice of your proposal betrays your attitude, and no one wants to deal with a prima donna.

But don't undercut yourself, either. Look to remove words that soften your message: "probably", "often", "sometimes". You're going to stand on stage and deliver a message -- you must be confident that it's worth hearing.

If you have some related credential make sure you mention it in the proposal or (preferrably) in a note to the organizers. You're pitching a talk about a Gem you wrote? Or you're on the core team? You've deployed your strategy in an app that's serving bazillions of requests? Mention it.

### Pay Attention to Your Audience

This is a lesson I learned the hard way. 

In the Ruby community, there's about a 96% overlap (*warning*: completely made up statistic) between people who work with Ruby and people who work with Rails. But for conferences there can be more of a distinction. 

Pay attention to the name of a conference. Is it called a **Ruby**Conf? If so, *don't propose a talk about Rails*. The organizers were intentional about choosing the name, and proposals that are doing interesting things with Ruby away from Rails are going to stand out.

### It's OK to Not Know

One of the most frequent things I hear from people that don't submit conference talks is "I'm not expert enough in anything." Guess what? Me either.

Giving a conference talk isn't about being an expert. Some of the best talks I've seen are explorations -- "I started with this question, and here's how I found the answer."

I often use conference talks to push me to learn new things. Two years ago, I'd never used Internationalization in an actual app. I wrote up a conference proposal with the pitch that I'd explain how to get going with i18n and some pitfalls to watch out for. 

Then, only once the talk was accepted, I started working with it. I admit this technique is not for everyone, but I work best under pressure. Most of the time you'll have two or three months between when a talk is accepted and when the conference happens, which should be plenty of time to learn and practice whatever you pitched.

That proposal up above? When I proposed it, I hadn't written a single line of code. I'd forgotten how logic gates are used to create flip-flops. But once the talk was accepted, I got to work.
