# Purposeful Onboarding

## Abstract

In our industry, a well-organized onboarding experience is an exception rather than the norm. This has to change. 

Based on study of three different development teams, this session will explore patters for quickly getting people up to speed including:

* ?
* ?
* ?

Once understood, these techniques can be used by both the existing devs and the new team members to improve efficiency.

## Details

Based on my research we'll explore:

* What happens the first day?
* What should be expected in the first week?
* Shipping a first feature

In addition I'll highlight how working solo provides beginners with a playground to test their knowledge while giving them the opportunity to explore new areas of the application and the problem domain. It goes on to cover some caveats and ways to minimize and/or avoid their negative ramifications. It explores ways folks can continue their growth upon successfully onboarding with the team. It ends with brief look at pertinent resources and likens the onboarding process to Agile Software Development as they both champion embracing uncertainties and making progress through small, deliberate steps.

The intended audience are programmers who have limited experience starting on a new team. However, I am confident that experienced programmers will find these strategies useful as well. I have successfully applied most of these strategies when I have switched teams. I have also used the concepts here to help a new person joining our team get comfortable with the codebase and the software development process. The talk will also help experience programmers understand the challenges a new person joining the team enabling them to improve the current onboarding process at their respective organizations.

## Pitch

I came into the Ruby community with a computer science background and programming experience. But it was *still* challenging to get started on my team. It's so difficult to learn the problem domain and the technical stack while trying to deliver value. 

The progression I describe in this talk is, in many ways, the kind of experience I wish I had when I was starting out.
