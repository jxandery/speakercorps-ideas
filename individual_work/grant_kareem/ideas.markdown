## Conference Talk Ideas

### Page Object Pattern for Feature Tests

Capybara tests has become the defacto way of running acceptance tests in rails. However as your codebase starts to grow, relying solely on Capybara's provided DSL can lead to duplication and brittle tests. Applying the page object pattern to your acceptance tests allows you to encapsulate the capybara DSL into an application-specific API that significantly reduces code duplication and is much easier to read.

### Angularjs with Rails - Best Practices

I'm adding this because I've been playing around with Angular and toying with the idea of combining rails and angular. Resources (i.e. blog posts) on the subject are scarce and most of those posts are incomplete. However, as I write this description, it seems like it would fall under the category of a 'Readme rehash'. I'm open to suggestions on how I can make this talk more interesting and engaging.
