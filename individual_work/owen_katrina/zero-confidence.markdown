Your tests failed. Again. And they didn't just fail, they failed you. There was no bug. There was no regression. You changed something trivial -- an implementation detail -- and your app still works but your tests are broken. They don't have your back. What purpose do they serve?

In this talk we'll evaluate the unit tests from an open source codebase. We will cover the roles a test plays in the lifecycle of a project, and explore guidelines that let us assess their worth, and determine which tests should live, which must die, and which are missing.
