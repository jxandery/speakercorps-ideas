Skill is not about talent, and mastery is not about perfection.

Is talent a genentic boolean? Does success come simply because of our natural skill, or is there a path to success that includes hard work and finding your passion? And if the path includes passion, how do we capitalize on it to maximize our success?

Taking a systems approach to passion, success, and mastery, it's possible to discover a means for bypassing that potential boolean. We can hack our way to success, enjoyment, and a passion-filled life.
