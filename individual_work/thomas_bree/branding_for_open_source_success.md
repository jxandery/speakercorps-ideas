## Branding for Open Source Success

If you build it, they *might* come. We all want our open source projects
to be widely adopted, but competition in the open source
landscape is fierce. Reaching levels of notoriety and adoption akin to
the likes of Linux, Rails, or WordPress is increasingly challenging
amongst today's volume of seemingly never-ending options. 

How do you differentiate in a way that is meaningful? In this talk we'll explore:

+ Four up-and-coming open source libraries that are doing it right, working to identify 
  commonalities in their approach to brand, content and marketing communications.
+ Some brilliant basics for establishing a communication approach for an open source
  project of any size/nature, so that it is clear, concise and easy to talk about.
+ Building an identity for your project with a personality
+ Going beyond what it does and focus on 'why' you do it
+ Brand and cultural considerations to keep in mind as the project grows, and new voices
  become contributers and maintainers.

With just a bit of planning and effort, building a 'who', not just a 'what', any
open source library can foster a community.
