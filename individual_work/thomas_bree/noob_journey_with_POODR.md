## Noob Journey with POODR 

As a new programmer, reading Sandi Metz's Practical Object-Oriented Design in
Ruby was a love, hate, and finally love again
journey. Inspired by Sandi's wise words, I embarked on a
major refactoring project, hell-bent on righting the wrongs of
my past design decisions and creating a well-oiled object-oriented
masterpiece. 

This is the story of ‘Falling in Love in Six Acts’:

+ Act 1: LUST
+ Act 2: EUPHORIA
+ Act 3: FEAR
+ Act 4: DISGUST
+ Act 5: THE TRUTH
+ Act 6: THE FINALE

Learning to program about falling in love with the struggle.

### Deeper Notes

+ Act 1: LUST: "This is it. The big wow. The thing you've been waiting
  for." 
  Several months into my six month programming school, I start reading Sandi's book,
  and I am instantly smitten. I totally "get it". I can do this in my own code! I have just the project for it... 

+ Act 2: EUPHORIA:  "You feel you can do anything and no one would dare
  laugh at you." 
  This refactor will be epic. It will channel 
  purist extremes. Models backed by the database will be pristine entities 
  of only their data attributes, devoid of any extraneous methods that I was previously too lazy to
  pull into service objects. And those service objects will have
  service objects, all interacting blissfully in a sea of
  single-responsibility.

+ Act 3: FEAR:  "This is the where the doubt begins, where the mind
  comes back from shopping." 
  So am I overboard? Am I doing extra work for no return? Will this matter in the real
  world?

+ Act 4: DISGUST: "Now comes that unavoidable time when you say to
  anyone who will listen: what the heck am I doing anyway?" 
  The purist view is just that - a view. You won't see it in the real world, ever.
  It is anything BUT practical. And I have a deadline to meet. 

+ Act 5: THE TRUTH: "It's easy to love something when you don't have to
  work at it. It's harder when it asks something of you." 
  Well, I'm already over half-way in this refactor. I can't quit now. And I don't want to half-ass
  it. I committed to the extreme, so let’s see what happens.

+ Act 6: THE FINALE: "There is something to be gained from commitment.
  There are rewards for staying when you would rather leave." 
  I learned the most from this project. I had real ownership. And now I know what is possible. And I will be a better programmer for it.
