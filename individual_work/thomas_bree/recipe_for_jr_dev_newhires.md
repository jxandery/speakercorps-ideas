## You've Hired a Junior Developer, Now What?

There are dozens of developer training programs and colleges graduating 
people they think are ready to write production code. And while the 
future certainly looks bright for the up and coming noob cadets, most 
are not ready to jump into the fire on day one.

But we need to turn these people into senior engineers. How do successful
teams do it? Based on a study of three different development teams, let's explore:

+ How many senior devs do you need to properly mentor juniors? What's the right ratio?
+ How can mentorship really work?
+ How can a junior developer carry their weight?

Based on these examples we can emulate success and bring up the next
generation of great developers.
