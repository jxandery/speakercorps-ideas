## You Can't Hit What You Can't See

### Proposal

There are several organizations and countless well-meaning individuals trying to fix our diversity problem. They're making small steps and are gaining momentum.

But the biggest problem isn't getting under-represented groups interested in being developers. Everyone wants to create things, to be paid well, to have a flexible job, and to solve challenging problems. The problem is this: we can't define "developer."

If you're a chef striving to be the best at your craft, you might try to earn a Michelin star. If you're a runner, you try to win a gold medal at the olympics. But if you're a developer, how do you claim mastery of your craft? How do you measure yourself against the great ones? How do you know what to practice, where your strengths and weaknesses lie?

"Just do programming."

Could we develop, collect, group, curate, and track a set of academic standards that explain what it means to be a Ruby developer? If we had such a list, outsiders who don't fit our majority mold could have a chance at developing and demonstrating their mastery without being "in the network." They could make an organized, logical journey towards developing expertise and know, objectively, that they're making progress.

That's how you cultivate diversity.

### Status

* I don't think the proposal was ever submitted anywhere, though it led to some of the ideas in other talks
