# Excellent Technical Interviews

## Abstract

How do you recognize technical talent? I've watched hundreds of developers
go through technical interview processes at dozens of companies. From 45-minute
puzzles to week-long pairing visits, there are many models for evaluating
technical skills. But are they effective?

Let's talk about what aptitudes you should be looking for and concrete techniques
to separate the good from the good-enough.

## Details

Over the past three years I've helped a hundred new developers find great jobs.
Some are at tiny startups and some at huge enterprises. But most technical
interview processes are a mess. They have unclear goals, a poorly thought-through
process, and yield unclear results.

Featuring observations from some of my favorite processes (ThoughtWorks, Pivotal
Labs, and Mode Set) we'll explore a rational, organized process for (A) defining
the ideal characteristics you're looking for and (B) discovering how well an
applicant aligns with those traits.

The session will follow this general outline:

1. What should you be looking for in a technical interview?
2. How technical interviews go wrong
3. Exemplar processes from three excellent interview processes
4. Why do those processes work?
5. A strategy for designing or re-designing your own interview process

Attendees will walk away with a better understanding of what their peers are
doing for technical interviews, strategies for designing an interview process,
and motivation to improve what they're doing.

## Pitch

I've been on the "inside" interviewing several developers per day for an
enterprise team, interviewed candidates for my own small team, and most importantly
coached over a hundred developers through the application/interview/contract as
they enter new jobs. I've been amazed to see the variety, for better or worse,
across processes. It's become clear to me that we can do better.

Through this session I hope to start a dialogue of transparency around interviews.
There's no reason a process needs to be shrouded in secrecy. There are hundreds
or thousands of developers who've taken Pivotal's RPI, but that doesn't make it
any easier to get a job there. Effective evaluation processes
don't rely on surprise.
