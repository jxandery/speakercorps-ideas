## Learning Ruby is Hard

### Proposal

For many among our community of developers, Ruby is their first and only language. To an experienced programmer, learning Ruby seems a hell of a lot easier than Java, C, or Assembly. That that only makes it the least-shitty to learn.

In the classroom, inquisitive students call you on your bullshit. When you just wave something off as "just type this," someone asks "why?" But out there, in the real world, you're focused on getting things done. Too often, you skip over the "why?" and the "how?" in the name of productivity.

Our community is getting bigger, older, but not necessarily smarter. With a constant influx of new developers and one library dominating the bulk of development, the average developer is following patterns that they don't understand. That's not programming, that's typing.

I've spent the past four years teaching Ruby, and in this session I'll share with you the lessons I've learned. This sticking points that trip up new developers, the bits that are hard to explain, what they're actually doing under the hood, and how each of them reveals a weakness in our patterns and practice.
