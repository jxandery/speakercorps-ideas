## Advanced Patterns with Ruby on Rails

*Note: This proposal is for a three-hour workshop*

### Proposal

Rails is an incredible framework for building applications quickly. But many projects never mature, they just grow bigger.

Let's experiment with patterns that allow us to maintain high development velocity and our application to stay healthy. It just so happens that these patterns also help scale your application to thousands of requests per second. 

We'll work through:

* Implementing asynchronous workers
* Adding presenter objects to the view layer
* Adding facade objects to the data layer
* Separating business logic from persistence
* Breaking out functionality to coordinating applications

Great applications are crafted. Move beyond the basics and build Rails applications that last.

### Reviewer Notes

This session is for experienced Rails developers looking to take their skills to the next level. Ideally you've been building Rails applications for at least a year, feel comfortable with the framework, and are proficient at Ruby.
