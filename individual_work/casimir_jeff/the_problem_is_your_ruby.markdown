## The Problem Is Your Ruby

### Proposal

We're facing a tidal wave of rescue projects.  So many developers dive into writing Rails applications without building a real foundation in Ruby.  Instead we focus on the new whiz-bang features of Rails or the hot gem of the week -- missing the awesomeness right in front of us.

Let's talk about Ruby and fill in some of the gaps.  This isn't about mind-blowing features and crazy metaprogramming, it's about the fundamentals that are often overlooked in Rails applications.

 * WTF are modules, anyway?
 * Writing utility objects
 * Measuring performance
 * Everything worth manipulating is a collection
 * Five Rails "features" that Ruby does better
 * Bringing science back into development

Master these techniques, and write better applications with better Ruby.

### Status

* This talk was proposed and delivered at a few conferences in 2010/2011 including GOGARUCO
