## Computing from First Principles...in Ruby

### Proposal

Writing good Ruby is all about creating abstractions. Meanwhile, there are amazing abstractiona right beneath your fingertips: electrical signals abstracted into binary numbers into logic gates into flip-flops, registers, ALUs, on up.

Let's bring the world of low-level hardware into object-oriented Ruby and explore:

* Building foundational logic gates in Ruby to mimic the hardware
* Using those gates to construct flip-flops and multiplexers
* Using those components to create memory and adders
* Then building fundamental components like ALUs and CPUs
* Implementing fundamental instructions (like the 8088 set)
* Using those instructions to implement algorithms
* Visualizing the whole execution path while instructions are clocked through the system

High-level languages offer us the privilege of ignoring the hardware. But developing a deeper understanding of how the machine is constructed can influence how we design and abstract complex systems.

### Status

* This talk was accepted to RubyConf 2013, but I had to cancel a few days ahead of time
* I'll likely pitch this to an August/September 2014 conference
