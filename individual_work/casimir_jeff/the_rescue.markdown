## The Rescue

### Proposal


In 2009 everyone was building web applications, technology was moving fast, and many developers didn't know what they were doing. Now we're paying the price. There are hundreds, maybe thousands of companies trying to survive the garbage software that drives their business.

Rescue projects are the most challenging and important work you can do as a developer. But not without a strategy built upon:

* People Problems
* Starting with Metrics
* Refactoring for Understanding
* Comment-Driven Development
* Unit Testing Foundation
* Bug reports and Integration Tests

Rescuing a project is more than software. Let's do it right.

### Notes

* This proposal was submitted and delivered at several conferences in 2011/2012 including Mountain West RubyConf and Ruby Hoedown
