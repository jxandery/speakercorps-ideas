# Sinatra Isn't a Stepping Stone

## Abstract

Sinatra is a fabulous way to get introduced to HTTP and Ruby web applications.
Once developers begin working with Rails, though, Sinatra is usually relegated
to a 'someday, maybe' tool.

But that's misguided. Sinatra is a fantastic tool for building general web
applications, APIs, data backends, you name it. Let's look at a few practical
examples and pull out common patterns to building great Sinatra applications.

## Details

The audience for this talk will be (a) more junior developers who've heard of
Sinatra or maybe used it for a trivial application and (b) senior developers
who are interested in bringing Sinatra into their workflow.

Wrapped by discussion, this session will center around code. We'll focus on two
powerful, real-world uses of Sinatra: (a) a pull-through cache for an external service
and (b) an easily tested web API backed by ActiveRecord and fronted by EmberJS.

The general outline for the talk will be:

1. Understanding the Sinatra landscape: perceptions and reality
2. Sinatra as a wrapper: building a pull-through cache
3. Sinatra as a connector: Ember on the front, ActiveRecord on the back
4. Sinatra and sane web application testing
5. Getting started with your project

By the end, attendees will have a better understanding of how Sinatra can be used
to build meaningful applications and the motivation to make it happen in their
own projects.

## Pitch

Having built about a dozen Sinatra and too-many Rails applications, I love the
simplicity Sinatra offers. There's less to understand. Less to mess up. It's
easier and more straight forward to test at multiple levels. Long story short,
Sinatra makes it easier to focus on the business value of an application.

I think it's a mistake that this great tool is often misunderstood. Having
taught dozens of developers how to work with Sinatra, I'm confident that I can
create more converts.
