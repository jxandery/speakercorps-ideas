## Internationalization Isn't a Bad Word

### Proposal


It's one of those features that we put off far into the future: "we'll internationalize when everything is done." Like when it exits "beta"?
Riiight -- just after you rewrite your test suite and document all your code!

There's no reason to be scared of I18n in Rails, and it's easy to start using it early in your processs. Let's take a look at
how it works, strategies / patterns for success, and how it actually *improves* your Ruby.

### Reviewer Notes

The talk will feature:

* a quick overview of locale files and the i18n system is used/works
* i18n helps you get rid of "magic data"
* best-practices for setting the locale automatically with manual overrides
* where you do and don't want to use explicit translations
* suggestions for structuring keys
* structuring "magic" activerecord translations
* strategies for managing, validating, and translating your locale files
* validating translations in your test suite

#### Tweaked for RubyConf

The talk will feature:

* a quick overview of locale files and how the i18n system can be used with or without Rails
* i18n helps you get rid of "magic data"
* best-practices for setting the locale automatically with manual overrides
* where you do and don't want to use explicit translations
* suggestions for structuring keys
* structuring "magic" activerecord translations

### Status

* I pitched this talk to several conferences in 2012 and it was accepted/presented at Argentina RubyConf and or or two others
