## Why Developers Quit

### Proposal

In the conference hallway there's surely a job board where every square inch tries to convince you that they're the best place to work. Finding good developers is incredibly difficult.

As we build technical teams and companies, developer talent is the single greatest asset we hold. You could change the company name, you could scrap the product, you could delete all your users -- but a great development team can bring everything back.

Convincing developers to join your team is one thing, convincing them to stay is another. What's the real cost when a senior developer leaves you? The loss of team productivity, deep code knowledge and history, blow to team morale, cost to recruit a replacement, and ramp-up time for a new member add up to a staggering total loss -- maybe more than $100K.

So what do we do to keep developers? Buy them big monitors? Have good snacks? Pay high salaries? There's more to it than that.

In this session, we'll explore and explain the results of our research about why developers leave companies and, most importantly, what you can do to stop it.

### Reviewer Notes

We're currently conducting research and anticipate sharing data from over 300 developers along with dozens of team and department leads to anchor the discussion. This will not be a fluff piece of "be nice" and "communicate often", these are a collection of real, insightful, and concrete recommendations for building stronger teams.

### Proposal Status

* I submitted this talk to one or two conferences in 2013, but it wasn't accepted.
