# Culture of Coaching

## Abstract

Most of us are struggling to grow our teams. How do you preserve a culture as
you go from a handful of developers to a larger team? And how do you help those
developers become the people they want to be?

In this session we'll explore six things you as a team lead must do to guide
and nurture the growth of your developers.

## Details

I'll just get to the meat of the talk. Here are my six areas of support a
developer needs to be successful:

### 1. Concrete Goals

It's always hard to define metrics around code, but it's worthwhile to create
a set of medium-term goals for the developer to strive towards. Maybe they're
things like (a) be able to and comfortable deploying applications into production,
(b) complete ten "feature request -> pull request -> code review -> revision
-> merge" cycles on production applications, (c) deliver two brown-bag talks to
the rest of the engineering team. It's easy for developers to feel unsure about
their growth and progress. Concreate goals are a way to objectively demonstrate
both.

### 2. Feedback

A developer needs to have a one-on-one with
their lead once a week. That session is an opportunity to get/give feedback on
how the developer is progressing and contributing technically, strengths and
weaknesses in their code, and to discuss any issues with the team interactions.
This allows them to iterate and correct course quickly.

In addition, they should setup a one-on-one with the next level up the chain at
least once a month. These sessions are to focus on the bigger picture. How is
the developer progressing towards their goals? How are they providing value to
the organization? How is their team helping/hindering their growth? How will
they progress in the next six months? These session help set the larger
trajectory of their growth.

### 3. Guidance

Developers know that they should be constantly learning, but junior developers
don't understand the landscape well enough to figure out what's worth their time.
Tech-leads need to help their developers set weekly and quarterly learning goals,
then check-in on progress each week. What subjects and topics are they weak in?
What technologies would be the next logical step from where they are now?

### 4. Collaboration

Too often senior engineers say things like "Ask me questions if you get stuck!"
That's a lifeline, not collaboration.

Ideally team members setup standing
appointments to pair program or review code. Leave up to the pair what exactly
they work on, but make the session part of their growth plan. When it's scheduled,
rather than ad-hoc or in-case-of-emergency, the pair is more free to learn and
experiment. Collaborators might even use the time to work on something not a
part of the day-to-day work, like exercises from http://exercism.io

### 5. Time to Learn

Just doing the work isn't enough. Every developer needs some dedicated time just
to learn. The ability to focus on small parts of your learning in a
concentrated way leads to improved performance when it counts. For meaningful
learning, a developer needs two to four dedicated hours per week. And having this
time scheduled, respected, and preserved means that it'll actually happen.

### 6. Compassion

We know that everyone fucks up and brings down production. It's not to be taken
lightly, but at the same time new developers might be terrified of what's going to
happen to them when something goes wrong. Every dev team should have a
postmortem framework. When something goes wrong, we need to document
(a) what happened, (b) what allowed it to happen, and (c) how we stop it from
happening again -- checklists, software checks, etc -- instead of just "try
harder next time." The blame shifts from the person to the process. If we fix
the process, then we can continue to be falible humans.

## Pitch

Coaching developers has been my job for the past five years. With over
a decade of experience in traditional education, I've spent a lot of time
observing, researching, and experimenting. While these strategies are most often
applied to junior developers, what's good for them is actually good for ANY
developer. These are lessons that can be applied to every technical team.
