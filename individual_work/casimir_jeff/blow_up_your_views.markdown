## Blow Up Your Views

### Proposal

Whether you're new to Rails or have been around few years, chances are that your views are primitive. Detonate what you know about how views are written and let's start over.

In this session we'll discuss...
- Why your views suck
- Instance variables are stupid
- Kill helpers and work with objects
- Drawing the line between "C" and "V"
- Treating views as API customers
- Rethinking templating

By the end you'll be dying to blow up your views.

### Reviewer Notes

This talk emerged from planning my "Fat Models Aren't Enough" session for RailsConf.  I put together a great set of refactorings for the model layer, but it left me with all these ideas about making better views.  I'd love to share them with GoRuCo!

I run JumpstartLab where I travel the Earth teaching Ruby and Rails techniques.  I love talking to developers, learning about their best ideas, then spreading them. 

I've spoken at user groups across the US, presented at RubyConf, RubyNation, and MountainWest RubyConf.  I can promise that this session will be a highlight among an amazing lineup.

I travel the world teaching Ruby and Rails. I am particularly interested in bringing the computer science back into programming and applying old, great ideas to our work today.

### Status

* This talk was proposed and delivered at several conferences in 2010/2011, including GORUCO and RailsConf
