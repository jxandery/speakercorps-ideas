## Metrics-Powered Ruby/Rails Performance

### Proposal

"Ruby can't scale."

Ruby-powered applications are now pushing millions of requests per day. Scaling an application isn't about piling up hardware and dropping in the newest database fad, it's the combination of design and refinement.

In this session, we'll look at identifying hotspots in your code including:

* Excessive CPU usage
* Memory and object allocation
* Monitoring query count and duration
* Isolating data-store bottlenecks

This is about identifying the 1% of your code that, through optimization, can dramatically improve performance.

### Status

* In 2012 I proposed and gave this talk at several conferences including LA RubyConf
