## Speakercorps - Proposals

This is our repository to collaborate on conference talk proposals.

### Getting Started

If you're in the group as a potential speaker:

* Clone the repo
* Create a folder for yourself: `individual_work\lastname_firstname`
* Create in that folder an `ideas.markdown`
* Use the `ideas.markdown` to start brain-dumping ideas without regards to quality/viability
* You can checkout [Generating Ideas](https://github.com/speakercorps/proposals/blob/master/generating_ideas.markdown) for some questions to help get your brain in motion
